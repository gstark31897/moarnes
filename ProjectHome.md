MoarNES is an emulator for the classic Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. It is relatively new, and currently still in alpha. It is being continuously worked on an improved with the goal of being among the best NES emulators available. Is it there yet? Not quite, but it's a very useable and fairly compatible emulator still at this point. It is written from scratch in C, with no code taken from existing NES emulators.

Although a fairly basic emulator right now, I am working on implementing several major new features soon. For example, netplay support and re-recording for tool-assisted speed run creation.

I am also looking into the possibility of an extended debugger, an integrated assembler, and a tile editor to assist in developing homebrew NES software.
